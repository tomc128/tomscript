# Welcome to TomScript
#### A completely useless yet undeniably awesome programming language.

This language was created as an extremely high-level programming language suitable for anyone to learn! Originally started as a joke, we have been able to create a fully-functioning coding language for all to enjoy!
TomScript is built atop a Python-based compiler, which results in an extremely light-weight and efficient language.


## Features

- Console printing
- Variable declaration
- Calculation
- Simple and human-readable syntax
- Effortless build configuration
- Exe and Python build support


## How to use TomScript

Using TomScript is simple! Simply create a `.tms` file containing your code, edit the config to your preference, and run the compiler!


## System Requirements

- Windows 7 or newer
- Python 3.7 or newer


## Basic syntax

Every TomScript program is structured in the following way:
    
    start

    // code
    
    end

As you can see, the "start" and "end" syntax signals to the compiler the start and end of the code.

### Printing to screen

Printing to the screen is called using the "write" syntax. Simply type "write" followed by the string, integer or variable you wish to print.

    write Hello, world!

### Reading user input

To read input from the user, simply use the "user input" syntax, as shown:

    set variablename to user input

### Creating a variable

Creating a variable is simple! Use the "create variable" syntax, as follows:

    create variable name


Want to set a default value? Just use:

    create variable name and set variable to Steve

Here, we use "and" to tell the compiler to combine these operations.

### Setting a variable

Want to change the value of a variable during your program? That's easy:

    set name to Jim

### Calculating values

Want to add some spice to your life using numbers? Just use the "calculate" statement:

    calculate 6 + 7

To use the result of this calculation, TomScript handily creates a variable called "result" which works just like any other variable!

    write result
    create variable calculation and set calculation to result

### Comments

TomScript supports comments, meaning you can annotate your code without the compiler adding it to your program! Simply precede your comment with "//" like so:

    // this is a comment!


## Configuration

The `tms.config` file specifies the options that the compiler should use. It includes the following fields:

    source sourceCode.tms
    output sourceCode.tms.py

The `source` parameter specifies the input TomScript, and the `output` parameter specifies the Python output file. You should set these to your desired source file and output file.


### Supported build parameters

    option compile comments // when building to a Python file, this option converts your code's comments to Python comments
    
    option compile executable // this option builds to an exe file, as well as a Python file
    
    option compile debug // this option builds to an exe file, while retaining all temporary build files that are generated
    
    option commentLines 0 // allows you to comment before start in your tms file, edit to accommodate how many lines of comments you use, if any
